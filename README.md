For me different color schemes (as well as typefaces) both set the mood for my development environment, as well as offer utility in the way that I parse text.

Therefore I’ have used a different color schemes for iTerm and began to tweak them to make them perfectly match my needs. That’s kind of the back story of the »Relaxed« theme which once was based on [afterglow](https://github.com/YabataDesign/afterglow-itermcolors).

## Terminal color scheme
